Now take a look at the following questions and see how much you have learned.

The following code shows a function and part of the main program.
```
function areaTriangle(base, height)
  area = (base/2) * height
  return area
endfunction

//Main program
triangleBase = input(“Please enter the length of the base.”)
triangleHeight = input(“Please enter the height.”)

triangleArea = areaTriangle(triangleBase, triangleHeight)
print(triangleArea)
```

# Solution
A local variable = **area**
Global variables = **triangleBase** and **triangleHeight** and **triangleArea**
Parameters = **base** and **height**
