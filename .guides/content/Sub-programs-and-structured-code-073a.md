Sub programs are a natural way of implementing solutions developed from decomposition and abstraction because some of the tasks identified can be allocated to a sub program. 

Repeated sections of code need only be written once and called when necessary.
This:

- shortens the development time of a program
- means that the finished program will occupy less memory space when it is run.

### Benefits of using sub programs

- Sub programs also improve the structure of the code, making it easier to read and follow what is happening. 
- It is easier to check your code if you use sub programs because each one can be coded and tested independently.
- The program is easier to debug as each subroutine can be inspected independently. If changes have to be made at a later date it is easier to change a small module than having to work through the whole program.
- In large development teams, different members can be working independently on different sub programs. 
- Standard libraries of sub programs can be developed and reused in other programs.
